# 🐍 Python by Muhammad Faizan  

### 📘 Overview  
Welcome to the **“Python”** repository — a complete, beginner-friendly, and practical guide designed to help students **build strong Python fundamentals** through real-world examples, structured learning modules, and continuous practice.  

This repository follows a **repo-in-repo approach**, meaning each core Python topic (like Strings, Loops, Functions, etc.) is organized in its **own sub-repository (folder)** for better structure and learning clarity.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By following this course, students will:  
- Master **Python fundamentals** step by step.  
- Understand **logic building** and **problem-solving** through code.  
- Practice **real-world examples and challenges** after each concept.  
- Develop clean, efficient, and professional **coding habits**.  
- Get ready for **advanced topics** like Data Science, Machine Learning, and Automation.
